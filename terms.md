## USING MAC OS FORGE

To use a Mac OS Forge account, you must be at least 13 years old (or such older minimum age as may be required by applicable local law).

When you accept these Terms and complete the Mac OS Forge registration process, you become the account holder. As a Mac OS Forge account holder, Apple provides you with a limited, non-exclusive license for as long as your account is valid to use the account name and password provided to you for your account. Your account name, when confirmed by Apple, is your online identity. Do not reveal your password to other users. Your account is at risk if you let someone use it inappropriately. Apple will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to keep your password secure.

Subject to any specific license agreements for various Mac OS Forge software projects (including third party software projects hosted on Mac OS Forge)&mdash;See "Licensing of Software Projects" below - Apple may change, suspend or discontinue any (or all) aspects of Mac OS Forge at any time, including the availability of any Mac OS Forge feature or project. Apple may also impose limits on the use of or access to certain features or portions of Mac OS Forge, or restrict your access to any part or all of Mac OS Forge, in all cases without notice or liability. You must read and agree to any separate software or other license agreement or terms of use for particular projects, services or features of Mac OS Forge, if you elect to use those projects, services or features.

Apple also does not guarantee or warrant that any Content you may have in your account at Mac OS Forge, or hosted at Mac OS Forge, will not be subject to inadvertent damage, corruption or destruction. You are responsible for backing up, on your own computer, any important documents, images or other Content. Apple will not be responsible for any archiving or backup of any such information.

## ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY GUIDELINES

Apple encourages Mac OS Forge users to participate in the projects, discussion forums, and other forms of on-line communication and services available through the Mac OS Forge website. However, it is important to remember that there are rules and standards that you must abide by when you use Mac OS Forge. These rules and standards are described in these Terms. As a Mac OS Forge user, you agree to comply with these Terms, and you acknowledge that Apple has the right to enforce these Terms in its sole discretion. This means that if you, or anyone using your Mac OS Forge account violate these Terms, Apple may take any and all appropriate actions&mdash;this can range from the issuance of a warning about a violation to the termination of your access privileges for Mac OS Forge to legal action&mdash;as Apple deems necessary or appropriate. Apple is not required to provide notice prior to terminating your Mac OS Forge access for violating these rules and standards, but it may choose to do so.

You are solely responsible for any Content you may publish or store on Mac OS Forge and for your conduct, and the conduct of anyone using your account, while using Mac OS Forge. This includes but is not limited to the contents of all comments and messages generated or forwarded, and all Content in any files, folders, home pages or other transmissions, information, images or other interactions generated, transmitted or maintained on or through your Mac OS Forge account, or otherwise posted on Mac OS Forge. Apple will not be responsible or liable in any way for any such on-line distribution or publication. Apple cannot and will not review every message or other Content which may generated or posted on or through your account (although Apple reserves the right to monitor account holders' use of Mac OS Forge&mdash;see "Investigations", below), and Apple will not be responsible for anything in any of those messages or Content.

Your use of Mac OS Forge should conform to the requirements of the law, respect for the rights of other users of Mac OS Forge and third parties, and current standards for communicating on-line. By your use of Mac OS Forge, you agree to use appropriate conduct and language when you are online&mdash;this includes (but is not limited to) following the rules of any ISP, any other on-line services, these Terms and all applicable laws.

Apple reserves the right to terminate your access to Mac OS Forge at any time, with cause or without cause for any reason. Events that are likely to trigger termination include, but are not limited to any breach of these Terms by you (or anyone using your account), your infringement of Apple's or Mac OS Forge's or others' intellectual property, or any other circumstances which, in Apple's sole discretion, merit termination. In the event of termination, Apple may remove any Content you may have stored or posted on Mac OS Forge.

Inappropriate conduct falls into a number of categories. The more commonly understood categories are discussed below, although this list is not exclusive.

## Illegal, Tortious and Prohibited Conduct

Mac OS Forge may be used only for lawful and proper purposes. The laws and rules that apply in the off-line world must be obeyed on-line as well. Posting, transmitting, promoting, using, distributing or storing Content that could subject Apple or other Mac OS Forge users to any legal liability, whether in tort or otherwise, or that is in violation of any applicable law or regulation, or otherwise contrary to commonly accepted community standards, is prohibited, including information and material protected by copyright, trademark, trade secret, nondisclosure or confidentiality agreements, or other intellectual property rights, and material that is obscene, defamatory, constitutes a threat, or violates export control laws.

Examples of prohibited conduct are:

* Posting obscene Content (including child pornography)
* Planning illegal activity, such as building a bomb or counterfeiting money
* Advertising a lottery, ammunition, firearms, tobacco, alcohol, illegal drugs and drug-related paraphernalia
* Pretending to be anyone you are not&mdash;you may not impersonate or misrepresent yourself as another person (including celebrities), another Mac OS Forge user, an Apple employee, or a civic or government leader; Apple reserves the right to reject or block any Mac OS Forge user name which could be deemed to be an impersonation or misrepresentation of your identity, or a misappropriation of another person's name or identity
* Using false statements to get, or to attempt to get, account information or other private information from other Mac OS Forge or Internet users
* Engaging in copyright infringement or other intellectual property infringement, or disclosing trade secret or confidential information in violation of a confidentiality or nondisclosure agreement

If you believe that illegal, tortious or other prohibited Content is being transmitted through any Mac OS Forge service, you may report it to <abuse@macosforge.org>.

Apple reserves the right to cooperate with law enforcement authorities, including complying with warrants, court orders and subpoenas. In addition, Apple reserves the right to comply with any civil court orders and/or subpoenas.  If Apple decides to investigate or resolve possible misuse involving you or anything you do on Mac OS Forge, Apple is entitled, except to the extent prohibited by applicable law, to disclose any information about you in Apple's possession in connection with your use of Mac OS Forge and anything you do with Mac OS Forge to law enforcement or other government officials, as Apple in its sole discretion believes to be necessary or appropriate. By your acceptance of these Terms and your use of Mac OS Forge, you authorize Apple to take any such actions.

## Objectionable Conduct and Content

It is essential that all Content on Mac OS Forge reflect the provisions of these Terms. Apple reserves the right to remove Content if Apple becomes aware of any Content in any Mac OS Forge area which, in Apple's judgment, does not conform to these Terms. Apple may send you a warning about the violation of these Terms if your Mac OS Forge account was responsible for putting objectionable Content on-line, but we reserve the right not to do so. At all times, Apple reserves the right to terminate, with or without notice, the accounts of Mac OS Forge users who violate these Terms.

Examples of objectionable conduct and Content that violate the Mac OS Forge acceptable use policy are:

* Harassing, threatening, or embarrassing another Mac OS Forge or Internet user, including unsolicited commercial communications
* Stalking another Mac OS Forge or Internet user ("cyberstalking")
* Transmitting, storing or facilitating distribution of Content that is harmful, abusive, violent, racially or ethnically offensive, lewd, vulgar or (in a reasonable person's view) objectionable
* If you are an adult, requesting personal or other information from a minor (any person under the age of 18 or such other age as local law defines as a minor) who is not personally known to you, including but not limited to any of the following: full name or last name, home address, zip/postal code, telephone number, picture, or the names of the minor's school, church, athletic team or friends
* Posting Content that defames, abuses or threatens physical harm to others or yourself

Please remember that these are only guidelines; there are always "gray areas." Ask yourself if your communication is something that you would say in a room full of people you never met, or in the workplace. However, Apple reserves the right to make the final determination about whether Content is objectionable or not.

If you encounter something you find inappropriate, you may report it to <abuse@macosforge.org>.

## Copyright and Intellectual Property Infringement

Much of the Content available through Mac OS Forge is owned by others, and is protected by copyrights, trademarks, rights of publicity and other intellectual property rights. In addition, the Source Projects hosted on Mac OS Forge are subject to the terms of the respective open source license agreements (or other licensing terms) applicable to or accompanying such Source Project.  Before you upload or download any Content while using Mac OS Forge, make sure you have been given the legal right to do so by the owner of the Content and that you understand and agree to any applicable licensing terms.
	
Making or posting unauthorized copies of any Content can lead to the termination of your Mac OS Forge access and may even subject you to legal action. In addition, the owner of the Content may take criminal or civil action against you. If a Content owner takes legal action against Apple because of your unauthorized use of Content, you agree (to the extent permitted by applicable law) to hold harmless and indemnify Apple, its subsidiaries, affiliates, related companies, employees, officers, directors, agents and suppliers against any liability, claims, or demands, including the costs of Apple hiring attorneys to defend against the action.

If you believe that any Content in which you claim copyright has been infringed by anyone using Mac OS Forge, please contact Apple's Copyright Agent as described in our [Copyright Policy](http://www.apple.com/legal/trademark/claimsofcopyright.html).

## Violations of System and Network Security

Violations of system and network security are prohibited, and may result in criminal and civil liability. Apple will investigate incidents involving such violations and may involve and will report any suspected criminal activity to and cooperate with law enforcement.

During the investigation, Apple may suspend or terminate any or all of a user's Mac OS Forge accounts involved and/or remove the Content involved from Apple's system. If Apple believes, in its sole discretion, that a violation of these Terms has occurred, it may take responsive action, including but not limited to permanent removal of illegal or inappropriate Content from the Mac OS Forge system, warnings to the Mac OS Forge user(s), and the suspension or termination of the account or accounts responsible.

If, as a result of any such investigation, Apple believes that any criminal activity has occurred, Apple reserves the right to refer the matter to, and to cooperate with, any and all appropriate law enforcement authorities.
