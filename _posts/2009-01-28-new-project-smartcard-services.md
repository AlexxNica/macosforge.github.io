We have a new project today: [SmartCard Services](https://smartcardservices.macosforge.org)! The project is intended as a central clearing house for activity and development related to the seamless integration of smart cards, readers, relevant third-party software, and Mac OS X's identity system and credential stores (i.e., keychains).

Visit their [project page](https://smartcardservices.macosforge.org) for more details.
